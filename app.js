// Registering middleware
// We want to use middleware: 'body-parser' that ensures that we 
// parse the request bodies of incoming request. 
// bodyParser.json() will parse any incoming requests body and 
// extract any Json data which is in there, convert it to regular javascript
// data structure like objects and arrays and then call next automatically
// so that we reach the next middleware in line which are our own custom routes
// and then also add this JSON data there.

// The following means that the routes which we configured 
// below are added as middleware in app.js

// Adding a middleware handling all request no matter which 
// verb we used. The idea of the following middleware is 
// that it only runs if we didn't send the response in one
// of our routes before. Because if we do send a response, we
// don't call next, we just send a response, and therefore, 
// no other middleware after the one which send a response will
// be reached. In other words, the current middleware is only reached
// if we have some request which didn't get response, and that can only
// be a request which we don't want to handle.

    // If we provide a middleware function that takes 4 parameters
    // Express will recognize this and treat this as a special middleware
    // function, as an error handling middleware function. That means that this
    // current function will only be executed on the requests that have an error
    // attached to it, so where an error was thrown. In other words, this current
    // function will execute if any middleware in front of it yields an error.

        // response in total.
